# Hardware-FluoGallery-Endoseek
Created by iGEM GO Paris Saclay 2021

During the pandemic, the world was faced with the fact that medical resources were insufficient for taking tests and other manipulations. This problem especially affected people suffering from diseases that do not require emergency treatment.
As a partial solution to this problem, we propose a technology for testing patients for endometriosis, which does not include the amplification stage. (You can learn more about this on the project description page)
In order to get the final analysis, you need two things: a centrifuge (you can see a good prototype from the wonderful iGEM Rochester 2020 team at https://2020.igem.org/Team:Rochester /Hardware#DIY%20lab%20equipment) and a fluorometer.

Our team decided to focus on it.
We propose a compact fluorometer project. We were inspired by the idea of ​​creating a fluorimeter that you can assemble at home. It was especially important for us to understand that it is possible to do this in countries with an unfavorable situation, especially for women and children.

We focused on environmental friendliness, low manufacturing costs and ubiquitous availability of components. The fluorimeter does not use only crispr / cas technology, which means it can be assembled for any biosynthetic substrate that has fluorescence as a detection component.
